# CS7CS4_ML_Kaggle_Individual Competition
Individual Machine Learning competition as part of the 2019/20 machine learning module at Trinity College Dublin.

# FINAL_Kaggle.py was used to finally submit.

Other files were a progress through the competition to reach the score after trying many different possibilities.

* In *Kaggle_New_1.py* it was the beginning, just to ensure a submission, applied concepts and techniques to start with.

* In *Kaggle_New_2,py*, after learning from Kaggle_New_1, it was time to do Refactoring. Cleaned up all the code and started from scratch and cleaned up any unwanted codes to make it easier to read. This lead to an significant jump in my score in fact.

* In *Kaggle_New_3.py*, after playing around with few algorithms, decided to work on the features, and probably remove few unnecesarry features and if possible make countries more simpler by making into sub-regions (*a granular version of continents- like western africa, southern asia etc*). It made little difference.

* In *Kaggle_New_4.py*, after fixing on featuers, ended up deciding to work on algorithms that yield better results. So tried few algorithms like (but not limited to), Gradient Boosting, Decision Trees etc.

* In *FINAL_Kaggle.py* after learning from all the above, before going into deep neural nets, wanted to try sophisticated algorithms like CatBoost. It gave another significant bump in scores. Then worked on hyper parameters, selected features that needed to be passed, and encoding numerical values and random seeding for better results. After several tries with this, it had a satisfactory result.
